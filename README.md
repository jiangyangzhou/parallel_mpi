# parallel mpi project
It's a MPI programming project page, containing some programs in course parallel programming in practice.  
It's not easy to debug for C, and it's even harder to debug for MPI program.   
I hope this MPI repo could be benificial to your program.  

1. life game   
See life game forder, which parallelize the life game with openmpi. 
(Very very hard to debug...... I am tired)

2. binary search tree
It contain serial and parallel program to find optimal binary search tree given probabilities of element appears.  (hard for me)

3. matrix_multiply 
Just matrix-vector multiply.  

4. perfect number  
I only find 8 primes.
